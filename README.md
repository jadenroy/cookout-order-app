🍔 Cookout Order Application

Full-stack web application built with Java (Spring Boot) and React that allows users to create, manage, and complete cookout-style food orders in a collaborative environment.

This project demonstrates end-to-end development of a RESTful backend, a component-based frontend, and real-world application flows such as authentication, data persistence, and role-based actions.
